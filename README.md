# scrabblebag

## Background
I wanted to play multiplayer Scrabble with someone remotely over video-call, but using a physical board. Unfortunately, when trying this, all sorts of issues occurred with the tile-bag and hands getting out of sync. This site simulates the hands and tile-bag of a Scrabble game so you can play with others remotely.

Use the site to keep track of your hand and draws while keeping the bag synced and hidden. Keep track of all players' plays on the board by fishing out the needed letters from your physical tile-bag.
