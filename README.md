# scrabblebag

## Background
I wanted to play multiplayer Scrabble with someone far away while video-calling with them, but using a physical board. Unfortunately, when trying this, all sorts of issue with the tile-bag and hands getting out of sync occurred. This site simulates the hands and tile-bag of a Scrabble game so you can play with someone else, each using a board and each placing each player's tiles.
